          Hi! My name is Rodolfo, I am Portuguese and I was born in a small
          island named Pico, in the middle of the Atlantic. I currently live in
          Leipzig, Germany.

          I feel passionate about using simplicity and practicality as tools to
          solve problems and bring ideas to life. That is at least what I try to
          achieve through projects and dedicated learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          My first passion in tech was airplanes, however destiny brought me to
          a path where I work in web-development and keep gaining interest in
          data-science.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love reading Jos√© Saramago, I am caught up listening to Jacob
          Collier and everyday I believe more in the power of our inner energy.
