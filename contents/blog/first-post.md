  Olá, my name is Rodolfo, I am a front-end developer, and for some time now, I have had the urge to create my own blog. A place on the web where I can own my own content and showcase the projects I am involved in.

I share the belief that does not exist a <i>"better"</i> way to build projects when it comes to web development. So for this blog I decided to go with the tecnologies that I am confortable using, mainly Vue.js.</p>
<p>I watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOjbRDVQzH8" target="_blank">talk from Marina Aísa</a> about how she built her own blog with <a href="nuxtjs.org" target="_blank">Nuxt.js</a>, and I got sold on the idea of trying it out. The learning curve of the framework is pretty small for someone used to Vue and I personally loved how fast it is to route pages and how easy it is to add SEO.

However, my inner engineer had to know, <i>"What about the performance?"</i>
