  Olá, my name is Rodolfo, I am a front-end developer, and for some time now, I have had the urge to create a blog. A place on the web where I can own my content and showcase the projects I am involved in.

<h4>Why a blog?</h4>
<p>Lately, I have gotten involved in some side projects, either with social start-ups or my own. I feel platforms like Linkedin don't offer the space for a thoughtful explanation of each idea and what I learnt from it. So this blog comes as a solution to fill that gap.</p>
<p>Platforms like Medium would indeed be able to also fill it. However, I see two problems with it. The ownership of content, since I would be posting on a third-party, and performance, as I demonstrate on the next point.</p>

<h4> Thoughts on building the blog </h4>
<p>
I share the belief that does not exist a <i>"better"</i> way to build projects when it comes to web development. So for this blog, I decided to go with the technologies that I am comfortable using, mainly Vue.js.</p>
<p>I watched a <a class="blog-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOjbRDVQzH8" target="_blank">talk from Marina Aísa</a> on how she built her blog with <a class="blog-link" href="nuxtjs.org" target="_blank">Nuxt.js</a>, and I got sold on the idea of trying it out. The learning curve of the framework is pretty small for someone used to Vue and I loved how fast and easy it is to route pages and add SEO.
</p>

<p>I also believe in the power of simplicity, so one of my objectives while building this page was to keep a clean design, intuitive and mobile-friendly. I went with shades of black and white for background and font and kept the content centred, as that translates well for smaller screens and gives more breathing space on larger ones.</p>

<p>
However, my inner engineer had to know, <i>"What about performance?"</i>. I made two audits, one to the page I just build and another one to my Medium profile page. And I have to say, I was impressed with the score difference.

<h4>An open conclusion</h4>

<p>There is still a lot to learn, a variety of frameworks and languages to build with. This page is certainly a beginning in that sense and it should never become static and romanticized. I will keep trying to improve it while learning new ways to solve problems. I am excited about the future.</p>
