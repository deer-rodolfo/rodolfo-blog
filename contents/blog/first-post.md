  A collection of ideas and projects. That is the goal I have for this personal blog. I was looking for a way to document my path, my learning experiences and maybe some failures.

<p>My name is Rodolfo, I am a front-end developer and for some time now I had the urge to create my own blog. The idea with creating a blog is to have a platform where I would own my content and be able to showcase projects I am involved in. </p>
<p>Since I have been working with Vue.js for half a year, I decided that would be my go to technology to start. I ended up comming accors Nuxt.js, a Vue framework that simplifies the routing and overall bootstrap of a page, so why not give it a try?</p>
<p>After some soft learning curve I am happy to say I finally have online my first page with a blog. I write the post with markdown, I used bootstrap for an easy layout and everything seems to be working nicely.</p>
